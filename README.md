# Vets In Tech Final Project, Retail Page

## Retail Page App MVP:

## HTML/CSS: matches mvp mock up

## JS:

## 1. Add to cart button adds the item to modal cart page.

## 2. In the top right corner there needs to be a button that opens a modal to show the cart. It should show the original price and give the option to select however many they want of that product with the total.

## 3. Reviews button smooth scrolls onto the bottom section/element.
